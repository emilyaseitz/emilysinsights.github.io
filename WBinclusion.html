								<h2>INSIGHTS ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL INCLUSION FROM 2021 WORLD BANK SURVEY DATA</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/worldppl.png"alt="" /></span><strong>139 countries represented through 145,000 survey respondees on questions related to attributes such as education, sex, urbanity, employment, and access to financial products and how it correlates to income mobility.</strong></p>  
								<p><b>OBJECTIVE:</b> 
								   PERFORM EXPLORATORY AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON WORLD BANK SURVEY DATA TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS ON WHAT FACTORS lead to higher income mobility such as education and geographic location, as well as how sex and age contributes or act as barriers to economic mobility and participation in using modern financial products. Also will look at financial worries and attributes of participants who have the greatest financial concerns and barriers.</p>

								<h2>CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS</h2>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/maplarge.svg"alt="" /></span><strong>The data findings are inconclusive in illustrating a strong correlation between income mobility and education, neither with age, sex, or urban/rural locality to higher income levels. .</strong></p>  
								<p><b>CONCLUSION:</b> The data is so large and is intended to reflect 97% of the world's population which makes it hard to find strong relationships within such a large pool. The accuracy of the data depends on participation and getting a selection of responders that proportionately represents the entire population accurately, as well as getting consent from participants and truthful responses.</p>
